# machine-learning-for-earthquake-classify


For the automatic classification task of the types of earthquake events in Huating, we investigate some unsupervised, semi-supervised, and supervised algorithms, including Gaussian mixture model (GMM), K-means, linear discriminant analysis (LDA), quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA), Label Spreading(LS), and Self Training(ST).
